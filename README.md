# AmigasVntg Catalog

Amigas Vntg's repository of item pictures. Items uploaded to [Amigas Vntg Website](https://www.amigasvntg.cl) belong to an **Amigas Vntg Campaign (AVC)**. AVCs are numbered starting from 001, each year. For example, the first campaign of 2021 is named `AVC_2021_001` and so on. Inside the **Capaign Folder** items are named according to their unique SKU and a dash followed by a number from 1 to 9. For instance, `BLU-AZL-20210516-1954` (which can be found inside the previously mentioned campaign) have four pictures, being the first one `BLU-AZL-20210516-1954-1.jpg`.

Pictures are created using a 4:3 aspect ratio, thus, following a normalized size of 1920 Ã— 1440 px (height and width, respectively.) All the pictures are in the `.jpg` format, saved with the highest quality setting.
